📦 Supply Chain Performance Dashboard

An Excel-based dashboard designed to explore and visualize core supply chain KPIs. While the dataset is synthetic, the metrics and layout are modeled after real-world logistics reporting — covering everything from carrier performance to sales trends.

This project demonstrates my Excel, data analysis, and dashboard design skills, while also reflecting how my logistics background shapes the way I interpret and present operational data.

📈 Project Purpose

Having worked for 10+ years in container ship planning and a few years in automotive logistics, I know how difficult it can be to translate complex reports into actionable insights.

This dashboard was built to provide a clear, intuitive, and business-focused view of supply chain performance. It also served as practice for applying concepts from my ongoing Google Business Intelligence Analyst course.

Turning operational data into actionable insights

Designing a user-friendly dashboard layout

Thinking like a logistics/operations decision-maker
